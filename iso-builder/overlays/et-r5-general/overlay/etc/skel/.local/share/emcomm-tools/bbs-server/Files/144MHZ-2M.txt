Notes for the 2m Band Plan:


Note 1: Narrow Band Digital 2m modes are those with bandwidths of 3 kHz or less; for example, WSJT modes. Wide Band Digital 2m modes are those with bandwidths greater than 3 kHz but less than 30 kHz; for example, Packet.


Note 2: Although 144.000 – 144.025 MHz is listed as a satellite sub-band in the IARU Region 2 Band Plan, there are currently no satellites operating there, and the IARU Satellite Coordinator has confirmed that there is no plan to use that segment for satellites in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the RAC band plan will continue to use that part of the band for weak signal modes. Should satellites be assigned spectrum in that part of the band in the future, then the RAC band plan will be re-evaluated as necessary.


Note 3: Consult with the WSJT community regarding frequencies for EME and Terrestrial operations as these change with modulation schemes.


Note 4: Once contact is established on a Calling Frequency, operators should QSY to another frequency. For 144.200 MHz it is generally down for CW, and up for SSB. For 146.520 MHz FM, it is to any other clear FM simplex channel.


Note 5: Seven frequencies on a 20 kHz channel raster: 144.37, 144.39, 144.41, 14`4.43, 144.45, 144.47 and 144.49. Occupancy is to occur onlywhen available Digital frequencies within the sub-bands 144.9 – 145.1 MHz and 145.59 – 145.79 MHz are exhausted. Consult with your local digital coordination body regarding maximum ERP, Bandwidth and coverage area within this sub-band. Operation may occur on 144.31 MHz provided operating bandwidth and ERP do not cause harmful interference within the propagation beacon network sub-band.


Note 6: Consult with your local coordination body.


Note 7: Repeaters include FM, Digital (DMR, Fusion, DSTAR and related) and linear modes. Consult with your local coordination body for frequencies and modulation scheme allocations specific to your area, if available. Hotspots are not to be used on Repeater frequencies.


Note 8: Ten frequencies on a 20 kHz channel raster: 144.91, 144.93, 144.95, 144.97, 144.99, 145.01, 145.03, 145.05, 145.07 and 145.09. Consult with your local coordination body.


Note 9: Eleven frequencies on a 20 kHz channel raster: 145.59, 145.61, 145.63, 145.65, 145.67, 145.69, 145.71, 145.73, 145.75, 145.77 and 145.79 MHz. Consult with your local coordination body.


Note 10: The frequencies 146.40, 146.43 and 146.46 MHz continue to be used as repeater inputs in some areas. Consult with your local coordination body.


Note 11: Thirteen channels on a 15 kHz channel raster: 146.415, 146.430, 146.445, 146.460, 146.475, 146.490, 146.505, 146.520, 146.535, 146.550, 146.565, 146.580 and 146.595 MHz.


Note 12: Six channels on a 30 kHz channel raster, 147.420, 147.450, 147.480, 147.510, 147.540, 147.570 MHz.


Note 13: The use of Digital Hotspots is not recommended on 2m. If they are used however, maximum power output should not exceed 500 mW. Gain antennas should not be used. The control operator must monitor the Hotspot whenever it is operating.


Note 14: Six channels on a 30 kHz channel raster: 147.435, 147.465, 147.495, 147.525, 147.555 and 147.585 MHz. Consult your local coordination body for available frequencies, ERP and bandwidth.
